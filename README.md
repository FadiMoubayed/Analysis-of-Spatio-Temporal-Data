# Analysis-of-Spatio-Temporal-Data
This project is a part of my master's program in Geoinformatics at the university of MÃ¼nster, Germany.


Point pattern analysis for crime data offered by the British police. To get the data go to the following link
https://data.police.uk/
and chose your area of interest. The data is not provided on Github as the files are extremely large. You need to add a Data folder to the root directory and place the data files inside that folder.
The analysis is completely done in R. No external sofrware is used.
To get the project running on your machine change the working directory in the the markdown file to where the repository in locally located.
The relative path is provided. No need to add paths manually.
