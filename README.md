# Analysis-of-Spatio-Temporal-Data

## Description
This project is a part of my master's program in Geoinformatics at the university of MÃ¼nster, Germany.


In this project crime incidents in the city of Wiltshire are analysed temporally between the year 2016 and 2018 where summary statistics are preformed to answer questions regarding the temporal distribution of the incidents across the studied time span.

Additionally, different statistical approaches are used to test whether the spatial distribution of the crime incidents has a spatial pattern, or it falls under complete spatial randomness.

The data used in this project is offered by the British ploice through the following link:
